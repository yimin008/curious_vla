## News 

- 🎉 **CuriousVLA has been recommended to CVPR'26 Findings.** CuriousVLA is very suitable to serve as MLLM auto-regression-based SoTA baseline to compare. 

## TODOs

- [x] Paper release
- [x] Model weights on HuggingFace
- [x] Prompt Construction and Evaluation code
- [ ] Quick Start of environment(sft + rl + eval unified)(before Apr. 10)
- [ ] Training data (IL stage)(before Apr. 10)
- [ ] Model Weight after SFT (IL stage)(before Apr. 10)
- [x] Training code (RL stage: Basic reward function api server + SDR)
- [x] Training code (RL stage: ADAS)

Most will be released before late March, 2026. 

For obvious reasons about a certain confernce, our recent schedule has been significantly affected 🤷, and the remaining components will be fully released by April 10.

[4.10 Update]: (Uploading...) Data & Model in IL stage will be uploaded in https://huggingface.co/MashiroLn/Curious-VLA-dev.

- [ ] Whole Data Engine
- [ ] Lightning-fast(15x throughput) reward function api server, and faster evaluation

Above will be released future.

## Abstract

Imitation Learning (IL) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving. However, we identify a critical bottleneck: IL training produces **overly narrow policies** that collapse exploration and limit the potential of subsequent RL stages, causing RL to saturate prematurely due to insufficient feedback diversity.

We propose **Curious-VLA**, a two-stage framework that unleashes exploration across both IL and RL stages through three key designs:

- **Feasible Trajectory Expansion (FTE):** Generates multiple physically valid trajectories with step-wise normalized representation during IL, broadening the behavioral diversity of the learned policy.
- **Adaptive Diversity-Aware Sampling (ADAS):** Prioritizes high-diversity samples during RL to maintain exploration breadth.
- **Spanning Driving Reward (SDR):** Uses focal-style weighting to amplify the reward's value span, improving sensitivity to differences in driving quality.


## Results

Performance on the **Navsim** benchmark:

| Method | PDMS | EPDMS(V2) | Best-of-N PDMS |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Curious-VLA** | **90.3** | **85.4** | **94.8** |

<!-- TODO: add more baselines for comparison -->

## Getting Started

### Evaluation

You need to prepare **2 python venv**: `lf`(Llamafactory for deploy, py3.11), `navsim`(for evaluation, py3.9)

Details and Commands See [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md)

### Training

#### 1. SFT: comming soon

#### 2. RL:

You need to prepare **2 python venv** for `EasyR1`, `navsim`.

Details and Commands See [docs/train_grpo.md](docs/train_grpo.md).
<!-- 

### Training

```bash
# TODO
``` -->
